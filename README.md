## Project Overview

## Week 1
# Roles

Craig - Developed the ML mockup which can be found here: [ML Code](https://github.com/fadlnabbouh/final_project/blob/main/Initial_Cardio_Model.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/fadlnabbouh/final_project/blob/main/Log_Regress_Cardio_Model.ipynb). For our Machine Learning portion, we will run classification models: a logistic regression model and neural network model on a large dataset to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease. The dataset looks at objective values such as height, weight, age, and gender, measured health values such as heart rate and levels of cholesterol/ glucose, and subjective measures such as the patient's activity level and whether or not they smoke/drink. All data will first be preprocessed to be used in our models. Our dataset's target value is relatively balanced, approximately 50-50, so we will not be using techniques to resolve class imbalance.  

Hisham - Developed the ERD and database mockup, which can be found here: [ERD/ Database Mockup](https://github.com/fadlnabbouh/final_project/tree/main/ERD%20%26%20Sql%20PgAdmin). We will use three tables and join them to use in our ML models. In addition, we will use a large dataset with key information about disease prevalence and visualize the data for our dashboard. In addition, Hashim wrote the preliminary data cleanup code. 

Chris - Developed the technology mockup that can be found here: [Technology Mockup](https://github.com/fadlnabbouh/final_project/blob/main/Technology%20and%20Pipeline/technology.md) and worked on developing a process pipeline for the team to use when coding on this project, which includes making use of AWS services such as the database development and sagemaker to have code exist in the cloud.

Fadl - Created the repository and maintained it throughout the week. In addition, maintained the readme file and developed an initial presentation and dashboard mockup that can be found here: [Dashboard Mockup](https://github.com/fadlnabbouh/final_project/blob/main/Dashboard%20%26%20Presentation/dashboard_mockup.txt).

All members contributed to the project idea and initial data clean up process.
